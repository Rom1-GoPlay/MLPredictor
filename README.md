I made this in order to learn machine learning.

I first followed a French tutorial series on YouTube. You can find it [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO_fdPEVlfKqUF5BPKjGSh7aV9aBshrpY&si=anXhhKY9a7NL09jR).

Then, I decided to use my knowledge to make a python script (the ml.py file).

# How does it work ?
- First, in the data folder, there is the datagen.py file, this file can generate datasets from functions that are defined inside the file. When a dataset is generated, it is placed inside the data/generated folder. (This was not in the tutorial series)
- Then when running the ml.py script, a dataset is loaded from data/generated and train the model.
